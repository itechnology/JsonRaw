###This is the client-side JS implementation

    // Takes a collection of keys, and a collection of values as input and returns a classic JSON object
    JSONR.parse(keys, values)

The parse() implementation is the work of [Perter Olson](http://stackoverflow.com/users/546661/peter-olson), and was kindly contributed via StackOverflow

Thank you Peter !

#####The spec is still in the need of the reverse implementation, that takes a JSON object and splits it into a seperate collection of keys & values. If you are up to it, please let me know !
