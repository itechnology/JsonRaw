###This is the client-side JS implementation

    // Takes a collection of keys, and a collection of values as input and returns a classic JSON object
    JSONR.parse(keys, values)

The parse() implementation is the work of [Perter Olson](http://stackoverflow.com/users/546661/peter-olson), and was kindly contributed via StackOverflow
